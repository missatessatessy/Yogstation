/**
  * # Savant
  *
  * A race of small blue people who wear big suits to fit in with general society. Pronounced Sa'vän(t)
  *
  * Basically, the Savants wear these suits so they can do standard ss13 jobs. The suited savants are /datum/species/savant/suit.
  * Meanwhile, the 'naked' ones are /datum/species/savant. They are slower, weaker, and have tiny arms and legs.
  * Roundstart Savants are the suited variety. See [/datum/species/savant/suit]
